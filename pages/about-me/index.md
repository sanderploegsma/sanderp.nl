![Avatar](/img/avatar.jpg)

I like functional programming, code puzzles, cloud stuff and high-tech products.

Over the years I have done both back-end and front-end development, using different languages, runtimes and frameworks. Top contenders are (in no particular order): C#/.NET, Java, Kotlin, F#/.NET, Javascript, Typescript, React, Spring Framework, Apache Flink, Kubernetes, Google Cloud Platform, Serverless Functions and Gatsby.js.

I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and I have professional experience in different projects ranging from enterprise software, e-commerce platforms, service applications and machine software at companies like Philips Hue, Bol.com, Imperial Brands, The Sting and ASML.

In my free time I like to ride my motorcycle, listen to all sorts of music, snowboard and play couch co-op / board games. I write about stuff that might interest me, or things that I have encountered in my work or hobby projects.
